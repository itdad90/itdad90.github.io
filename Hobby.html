<h4 style="font-size:20px;">Welding</h4>

</center>


<img src="TigWeld.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 300px; height: auto;">
<p>I enjoy to weld. I like working with my hands and crafting things, and find it very satisfying to be able to create an exhaust, or weld up body panels. Hope to one day be able to lay weld beads like some you may come across on instagram.</p>

<center>
<h5 style="font-size:20px;">Racing</h5>
</center>
<img src="RollRace.jpeg" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 300px; height: auto;">
<p>Along with welding, I enjoy the end result of doing work on vehicles, such as racing and general driving. This includes going to car shows and cruise-ins, seeing the work, time, and dedication that people pour into their vehicles is inspiring and fun.</p>

<center>
<h6 style="font-size:20px;">Gaming</h6>
</center>
<img src="Gaming.jpeg" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 300px; height: auto;">
<p>In whatever free time left after spending time with the kids and the other hobbies that I have, I enjoy gaming with my brother and friends. Its not always possible to hang out often, and I find the online aspect of gaming mentally stimulating, as well as being able to enjoy time with friends.</p>

<center>
<h7 style="font-size:20px;">Riding Motorcycles</h7>
</center>
<img src="Dualsport.jpeg" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 300px; height: auto;">
<p>Though I have sold my motorcylce now, one of my passions has always been riding. There is a sense of freedom and being care free that is hard to find anywhere else. While it requires more attention, I find it to be quite relaxing. 
</p>

<center>
<h8 style="font-size:20px;">Time with my Family</h8>
<img src="Family.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 300px; height: auto;">
<p>Safe to say that time with my family, takes up most of my free time, but I wouldn't trade it for any hobbie or interest on the list. Family is where I find the most enjoyment and fulfillment.
